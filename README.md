This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Secure Healthcare Information Network System a multi-department healthcare organization operating across multiple floors within a corporate building. The organization supports a large and diverse user base, including medical staff, laboratory personnel, administrative teams, IT professionals, auditors, and external guests. In addition, the company relies on cloud computing services and VoIP communication systems, which further increase the complexity and security requirements of the network infrastructure.
The primary objective of this project is to design a robust, highly available, and secure enterprise network using a hierarchical network model that incorporates redundancy, segmentation, and centralized management. The proposed solution utilizes Cisco networking technologies to implement VLAN segmentation for LAN, WLAN, and VoIP traffic, secure perimeter defense using a Cisco ASA firewall, dynamic routing with OSPF, and high-availability mechanisms such as HSRP and EtherChannel. Virtualization and centralized server infrastructure are employed to enhance resource utilization, fault tolerance, and business continuity, while wireless and VoIP services are integrated to support modern communication needs.
Due to security requirements, it has been decided that all LAN, WLAN, and VoIP users will be on a separate network segment within the same local area network. The firewall will be used to set security zones and filter traffic that moves in and out of the zones based on the configured inspection policies.
You have been hired as a network security engineer to design the network according to the requirements set by the senior management. You will consult an appropriate robust network design model to meet the design requirements. You are required to design and implement a secured, reliable, scalable, and robust network system that is paramount to safeguarding the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data and communication.
By implementing industry best practices in network design and security, this project aims to deliver a scalable infrastructure capable of supporting current operational requirements while accommodating future growth. The final network solution ensures secure internal and external connectivity, efficient resource management, and reliable service delivery, making it well-suited for a healthcare environment where data protection and system availability are paramount...
